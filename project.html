              <br>Waste Kompost Radio is a sonic composting art project. It is 
              conceived for <span class="bolding">Pro Helvetia’s NEW ECHO SYSTEM</span> residency plan 2022. 
              The radio will be presented and launched as a sound installation 
              on <span class="bolding">21 October 2022 at Palazzo Trevisan, Venice. </span></p>


              <p class="bolding general_text">The Radio</p>

              <p class="general_text" > WKR is a constant radio flow composed of 
                sonic waste discarded during editing processes. During the year, 
                WRK invites artists, musicians and radios to contribute by sending 
                their sonic waste which will be processed through neo-built algorithms 
                which gradually decompose the sonic information throughout the year, 
                applying the same mechanisms of biological and chemical reactions which 
                decompose organic material into compost.WRK will be available to listen 
                to as a web stream on your phone, computer or internet radio at home. </p>

                <p class="bolding general_text">Concept</p>

                <p class="general_text" > 

                  The time in which we live is characterized by a disproportionate 
                  production of objects, which translates into a production of waste.  
                  We are in fact living in the age of waste. 
                  Waste culture is a culture that has unlearnt to reuse waste or to envisage 
                  a production where nothing has to be discarded. We prefer to relegate waste 
                  to non-visible hiding places, we use the margins as a receptacle for the unseen 
                  rather than enhancing them as a place of wealth, of proliferation of diversity. 

                  <br><br> We have long inhabited the earth following production cycles that 
                  provided for the use of materials without creating waste in connection with 
                  the spirit of transformation inherent in the material.  Recycling, use and 
                  reuse have always been part of our production processes until a reversal of 
                  trend occurred and a process of separation between the used and the new began. 
                  All this perhaps began even before consumerism and can already be read in the 
                  birth of the civilization of ruins. 
                  
                  <br><br>The challenge, precisely because we live in the wasteocene, is to be able to reverse 
                  this process, 
                  to develop an ecology of gestures that reintroduces, into our actions, respect for a 
                  material whose ontology lies in its transformation and not in its rejection.
                  
                  <br><br>Today, listening facilities such as radios, streaming services and social networks are defined by algorithms.
                  They discard what doesn’t correspond to the users’ tastes. 
                  
                  <br><br>Recovering an attitude towards the valorization of waste, rewriting our 
                  relationship with matter, with materials, with living beings and thus redesigning 
                  our possibilities in the cohabitation of the world. 
                  All this belongs to our culture, both material and social, but also acoustic. 
                  
                  
                  <br><br>Our acoustic "education" orients us towards the "clean" sound, the perfect sound, 
                  the infallible sound, the known sound, and consequently towards the elimination 
                  of "sound rejects" from the listening landscape. Yet it is precisely in the waste, 
                  in the margins, that it is possible to find renewed creative richness. 
                  
                  <br><br>To spread a culture of sonic recycling, to contrast the ease with which we are accustomed 
                  to throw away what is not listenable, rather than to enhance the waste and try to listen 
                  to the unlistenable, to move towards a culture that involves processes of reuse, where waste is valued and produces abundance, WKR was born.</p>
                  
                  <p class="general_text"><i>WKR is a sympoietic act of creation<br>
                  WKR is Ulysses rejecting the wax corks<br>
                  WKR is a process from abandonment to abundance</i></p>
