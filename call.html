            <p class=" general_text" >We are looking for sonic contributions to create a new radio in October 2022 which will only play discarded material.
            Radios, composers, artists from around the world are invited to become part of this collective radio by sending their unwanted “sound waste”, 
            everything which couldn’t be included in the final result, wrong or useless and therefore cut out. 
            All the waste will be collected to create <span class="bolding">WKR - Waste Kompost Radio</span>.

            <p class=" general_text" >WKR will be a constant radio flow composed 
              of sonic waste discarded during editing processes. During the year, 
              the collected waste will be processed through algorithms which gradually 
              decompose the sonic information through applying the same mechanisms of 
              biological and chemical reactions which decompose organic material into compost.</p>
            
            
              <p class=" general_text" >In order to collect sonic waste, 
                WKR  is launching several calls for contributions throughout the year.  
                The sonic waste from each call will be collected in a database and activated 
                into its compost-process at the official launch of the radio on 21 October 2022,

            <p class=" general_text">All kinds of discarded sounds. 
              Central to the concept is your choice of considering 
              the sound not good for your final result. They can be from:<br>
            - radio programmes <br>
            - music recording sessions <br>
            - music post productions <br>
            - field recordings <br>
            - general sound recordings (interviews, phone calls, sighs, inappropriate laughter, ehms, ...)<br>
            - ... 
            <br>
            These are just some examples. Feel free to send us whatever was not fit.<br>
            Formats: mp3, wav, flac, ogg, and anything that digitally plays.</p>
